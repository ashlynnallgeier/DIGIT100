                <p>
                    I am a senior at Penn State Behrend pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Digital Media, Arts, and Technology with minors in Communication Arts and Mass Media and Media Production. My passion lies in video production, photography, and creating engaging multimedia content that blends storytelling with technical skill.

                    I have professional experience as a Web Development Assistant at Behrend Library, where I contributed to content organization and site design. My main focus, however, is producing high-quality visual media across projects that involve filming, editing, and post-production workflows to craft compelling stories.                </p>

                    I am in the process of starting my own photography business, Ashlynn Allgeier Photography, where I aim to offer portraits, event photography, and creative multimedia services that help clients capture meaningful moments. I have also developed hands-on skills through volunteer work with The Band 814 and First Alliance Church, creating visual content, photography, videography, and editing videos for social media and event promotion. These experiences have strengthened my creative problem-solving, collaboration, and technical proficiency in tools such as Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, Photoshop, and Lightroom.                </p>
                
                <p>
                    My goal is to continue growing as a digital media creator and photographer, producing professional photography and multimedia content that informs, entertains, and inspires audiences. I strive to combine creativity, technical expertise, and storytelling to make meaningful and impactful projects.                </p>
