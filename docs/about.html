        <p>My name is Ashlynn Allgeier. I am a junior at Penn State Behrend, I am studying Digital Media, Arts, and Technology. This website is all about <strong>me</strong> and my hobbies. Here is <a
            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ama8232/">a link my linkedin page!
        </a></p>
        <p>My main interests in the digital media field are photography, vidography, photo and video editing, and graphic design. </p>
        <p>One of my other main hobbies is music; I am a vocalist, I play the acoustic guitar, and a little bit of piano. One instrument I would like to learn is the violin. I actively volunteer at my Church by being in the worship band every week as a vocalist. I also enjoy going on walks, enjoying nature, and hanging out with my friends.</p>
        <p>One major thing that I love to do in my free time is help out with a local Christian band, The Band 814. My boyfriend has been in this band since 2022 and I started hanging around the 814 team consistently since July 2023. I run sound at concerts. I also recently started being the band's visual content creator. I am the band photographer, I work on video editing, as well as helping to design merch and keeping the website updated. <a href="https://theband814.com/">The Band 814</a>.
