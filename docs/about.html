                <p>
                    I am a senior at Penn State Behrend pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Digital Media, Arts, and Technology with minors in Communication Arts and Mass Media and Media Production. My passion lies in video editing, filming, and creating engaging multimedia content that combines storytelling with technical skill.

                <p>
                    I have professional experience as a Web Development Assistant at Behrend Library, where I contributed to content organization and site design, but my main focus is producing high-quality visual media. I enjoy working on projects that involve video production, editing, and post-production workflows to create compelling stories.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Additionally, I have developed hands-on skills through volunteer work with The Band 814 and First Alliance Church, creating visual content, photography, videography, and editing videos for social media and event promotion. These experiences have strengthened my creative problem-solving, collaboration, and technical proficiency in multimedia tools such as Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Photoshop.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    My goal is to continue growing as a digital media creator, producing professional video and multimedia content that informs, entertains, and engages audiences. I strive to combine creativity, technical expertise, and storytelling to make meaningful and impactful projects.
