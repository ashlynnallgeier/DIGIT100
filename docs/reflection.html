           <p> Personally, I thought that Wordpress was a lot easier to learn than GitHub. Since we learned about GitHub first, I had a really easy time making a site on Wordpress. When it comes to GitHub, there can be a few challenges for a new learner. First, writing documents in Markdown can be a learning curve for those unfamiliar with it. Also, many tasks require using the command line, which can be intimidating for a beginner using GitHub. Something that was personally challenging for me with Wordpress was choosing a theme and sticking to it. It could also be challenging for beginners because of the lack of personalization; there are design limitations within the site.</p>
            
           <p> Some advantages that I found with GitHub were that it offers robust version control, allowing for the easy tracking of changes and collaboration for a site or any project. It also is ideal for students who are comfortable with coding and want full control over their site's functionality and design. Wordpress is a lot more user-friendly and more accessible for non-developers, with a visual interface and easy-to-use content management. It also works for a faster way to build a site because there is a wide range of themes and plugins which enables quick setup and functionality enhancement without coding.</p>
            
            <p>Changing the layout of a site usually requires knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, especially when using static site generators, which need an understanding of configuration and templates. In WordPress, customizing themes can be limited by their built-in settings, and while page builders make design easier, they can lead to excessive code if not handled properly.</p>
            
            
            <p>To develop sites on GitHub, you need basic skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with familiarity with Git commands and the ability to write documentation in markdown. For WordPress, knowing HTML and CSS helps with styling, while effective content management skills are important for handling posts and pages. Understanding basic SEO (search engine optimization) practices is also essential for improving site visibility.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>To enhance my skills, I plan to delve into advanced Git and GitHub. I want to further develop my portfolio website. I also want to learn more about CSS to develop better styling skills, as well as Java Script to add animation and more functionality.
