                <h1>Faith, Music, and Community: SoulStock 2025 Brings Hope to Rural Pennsylvania</h1>
                <div class="subtitle">By: Ashlynn Allgeier &nbsp;•&nbsp; St. Marys, PA — Aug. 1–3, 2025</div>
                
                <section class="blog-section">
                    <p>On a warm late-summer evening in St. Marys, Pa., Shawmut Park became a vibrant patchwork of families on blankets, kids darting through bubbles, and the aroma of grilled food drifting through the air.</p>
                    <p>This scene was from SoulStock 2025—a heartfelt, free, multi-day Christian festival hosted by Gather on the Grass Worship Inc., where music, ministry, and hope came together Aug. 1-3.</p>
                    <p>“It’s not just a concert—it’s a place for connection,” said <strong>Janice Swesey Schatz</strong>, the festival’s lead organizer. “We want people to leave knowing they’ve been seen, loved, and reminded they’re not alone.”</p>

                    <h2>A Festival with Deep Roots</h2>
                    <p>SoulStock started as a small gathering in 2019—a guitar, a mic, and a heart focused on worship outside church walls. Each year, the vision expanded: vendors joined, testimonies were shared, local ministries offered prayer, and churches pitched in. By 2025, it was a summer landmark, with people traveling from across the region and returning year after year.</p>
                    <p>“We’ve watched it grow from a handful of people to a crowd that feels like family,” Schatz said. “It’s proof that when the community comes together, God can do something beautiful.”</p>

                    <h2>SoulStock 2025 Lineup Highlights</h2>
                    <p>SoulStock showcased a vibrant mix of musical styles, from heartfelt worship to energetic Christian rap and gospel-infused praise.</p>
                    <p>On Friday night, Aug. 1, the spotlight belonged to <strong>The Band 814</strong>, whose powerful worship anthems and personal testimonies deeply connected with the audience, setting an emotional tone for the rest of the weekend.</p>
                    <blockquote>“We’re not here to put on a show. We’re inviting people into moments that matter.” — <em>Michael Simons, The Band 814</em></blockquote>
                    <p>Throughout the day Saturday, Aug. 2, a variety of artists kept the energy flowing, including Christian rappers Eric Cohen and JK.A, soulful worship from Saved by Grace, and creative performances by groups like Funky Samurai Party and Painting Freedom.</p>
                    <p>“The music spoke straight to my heart,” said local attendee <strong>Sarah Miller</strong>. “It felt like everyone was healing together through the songs.”</p>
                    <p>Saturday night featured two special guests: <strong>Brian “Head” Welch</strong>, known for his journey from rock legend to redeemed worship leader, and <strong>Ben Fuller</strong>, whose moving performance closed the evening with reflection and hope.</p>
                    <p>Sunday, Aug. 3, wrapped with a reflective worship service, rounding out a weekend full of music, ministry, and community.</p>

                    <h2>A Stage That Heals</h2>
                    <p>Lead singer <strong>Alexis Boyd</strong> shared one of the most humbling memories: watching someone in the crowd break into tears mid-song.</p>
                    <blockquote>“You realize you’re part of someone’s healing story,” she said. “That’s why we keep coming.”</blockquote>

                    <h2>More Than Just Music</h2>
                    <p>SoulStock buzzed beyond the stage. Food trucks served barbecue, pretzels, sweet treats, and cold drinks. Artisans sold crafts, jewelry, and local goods. Volunteer-run prayer tents offered compassionate listening and encouragement. Nonprofit booths connected families with resources and support in gentle, welcoming ways.</p>
                    <p>“Music draws people in,” Schatz said, “but it’s the conversations afterward—those quiet moments—that truly transform lives.”</p>

                    <h2>Community Impact</h2>
                    <p>SoulStock doesn’t just lift spirits—it also brings renewed energy to the local community. The festival featured face painting, sand art, raffles, and a variety of food vendors, creating a lively atmosphere that drew families and visitors alike. For St. Marys, SoulStock serves as both a spiritual outreach and a celebration that brings the community together.</p>
                    <p>“It’s spiritual, social, and economic hope,” Schatz said. “Everyone can get something from SoulStock—people from all walks of life.”</p>

                    <h2>Closing Notes of Hope</h2>
                    <p>As the final chords faded on Sunday, Aug. 3, groups remained, reluctant to part ways. Friends exchanged contact info. Some lingered in prayer. Others simply stood, absorbing the glow of shared moments.</p>
                    <p>“Every year, someone tells me SoulStock changed their life,” Schatz reflected. “That’s worth every note played, every tent pitched, every prayer offered.”</p>
                    <p>In rural Pennsylvania, SoulStock stands as living proof that open skies—and open hearts—can create ripples of hope that last long after the last song ends. Plans are already underway for SoulStock 2026, with dates and artist announcements to be shared in the coming months.</p>
