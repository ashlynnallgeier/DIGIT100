            <h1>Frontier Park: A Place of Memory and Discovery</h1>
            <div class="subtitle">A photo essay exploring childhood memories, reflection, and discovery in Frontier Park.</div>

                    <p>Frontier Park has always been a place that feels both familiar and full of new discoveries. I grew up spending a lot of time here, and so many of my childhood memories are tied to its paths, its bridges, and the quiet spots where nature opens up. Going back now with a camera, I see the park differently—not just as a space to play, but as a landscape filled with history, reflection, and possibility.</p>

                <div class="essay-section">
                    <p>My photo essay begins with the small outdoor amphitheater tucked within the park. I’ve always thought of it as a centerpiece, even when I was little. As a kid, it always felt almost magical, like a stage waiting for a story to unfold. Photographing it now, I see it as an establishing image—it introduces Frontier Park as a place where community, imagination, and nature come together.</p>

                <div class="essay-section">
                    <p>The bench under a tree is one of the most personal images in this series. Benches have always been quiet landmarks in Frontier Park. When I was younger, they were places to catch my breath or share a snack with my family. Today, they mean something more—an invitation to pause, to notice, to reflect.</p>

                <div class="essay-section">
                    <p>The creek carries a different kind of memory. I remember leaning over its edge as a child, tossing in stones and watching them disappear into the water. The creek has always been the park’s most alive feature—its sound, its movement, its shifting reflections. Community efforts have restored its banks, ensuring the water runs clear for future generations.</p>

                        <p>The bridges are the next step in this journey. As a child, crossing them felt like adventure—like entering a new world each time I stepped onto the other side. Today, I view them as symbols of connection, linking not just the physical sides of the park but also past to present, play to reflection, memory to discovery.</p>

                    <p>The sunlit path closes the series, and it is also my favorite image. Paths in Frontier Park have always felt like invitations—leading me forward when I was little and still leading me now. The sunlight stretching across the trail feels like a reminder of presence, of slowing down to notice where I am rather than rushing toward where I’m going.</p>

                    <p>Together, these images tell a layered story of Frontier Park. It is a space built on history, shaped by community, and alive through nature. But for me, it is also a space of memory—one that holds my childhood and continues to offer moments of reflection today.</p>
